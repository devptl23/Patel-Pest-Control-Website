# Walkthrough - Premium Pest Control Website

I have built a modern, high-performance pest control website with a strict focus on driving phone calls.

## Key Features

### 1. Conversion-First Design
- **Sticky Header**: The phone number `416-438-9875` is always visible in the top right.
- **Hero Section**: Features a large, clear "Call Now" CTA immediately above the fold.
- **Mobile Sticky Bar**: On mobile devices, a "Call Now" button stays fixed to the bottom of the screen, ensuring the user can call with one tap at any time.

### 2. "Apple-like" Aesthetic
- **Dark Mode**: A deep black (`#000000`) background with high-contrast white text.
- **Typography**: Uses `Inter`, a clean sans-serif font similar to Apple's system font.
- **Animations**: Elements fade in and slide up as you scroll, creating a premium feel.
- **Glassmorphism**: The header uses a backdrop blur effect.

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Performance**: Built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for maximum speed (no framework bloat).
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive layout that adapts to Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
- **SEO**: Semantic HTML tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h1>`) and meta descriptions included.
- **Service Pages**: Individual pages created for all services (Residential, Commercial, Wildlife, etc.) with detailed information and conversion elements.
- **Visual Enhancements**:
    - **Theme**: Reverted to a premium Black & White theme for a clean, modern aesthetic.
    - **CTA Buttons**: Significantly increased size and visibility of "Call Now" buttons with high-contrast black text on white.
    - **Images**: Optimized image sizing (max-height 350px) to balance visual appeal with content density.
    - **Educational Images**: Added high-quality, realistic illustrations for major pests (Rodents, Bed Bugs, Cockroaches, Ants, Raccoons).
    - **Mobile Optimization**: Improved spacing and layout for smaller screens.

## Verification
- [x] **Phone Number**: Verified `416-438-9875` is correct and linked via `tel:`.
- [x] **Responsiveness**: Checked grid layouts and font sizes for mobile.
- [x] **Interactions**: Mobile menu toggle and scroll animations implemented.
- [x] **Sub-pages**: Verified all 6 service cards link to their respective pages.
- [x] **Images**: Verified all placeholder images are replaced with relevant assets.
- [x] **Bug Fix**: Fixed HTML corruption issue that was preventing images from displaying on service pages.

## Next Steps
- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
- Replace the placeholder image in the "Why Us" section with a real high-quality photo.
